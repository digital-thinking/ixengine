# ixengine

This game engine was started as one of my first java/game projects in 2012, while studying.
It was used by several teams in game jams, so some parts are contributed by others.

The component design is flexible and powerful.
The engine includes Physics with Box2D, Lightning and Shadows though Box2Dlights and a transition capable interaction GUI based on the tween engine.
Moreover there is a spriter component, which allows to import spriter models and animation with skeletons.
